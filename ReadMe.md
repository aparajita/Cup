## Cup

Cup (Cappuccino Uploader) is a [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org) framework that wraps the fantastic [jQuery File Upload](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) library. Best of all, because itâ€™s based on Cappuccino technologies like KVO and bindings, it needs very little code to make it work.

For information on installation and usage, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/aparajita/Cup/wiki).
